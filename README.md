Lastly, the system will produce statistical reports of bookings made for a certain period.

## approach
The booking system for crown city car hire will be developed using the Object-Oriented Methodology. This approach allows for the re use of system components and it also helps to reduce the complexity of a system since it breaks down system components into classes and each class contains of methods and attributes. OOM can achieve higher productivity, lower maintenance costs and better quality, since the methods for implementing certain functionalities are distributed among their respective classes, which can be shared throughout the system. It also allows for easy maintenance of the system since code changes can only be made within one class instead of different parts of the system. It also uses Unified Modeling Language (UML), a modeling standard for object-oriented design and analysis that is widely used in the IT industry.
